### hi, I'm M1ke ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer, CTO of a startup, and I give talks & run workshops at events in the UK and beyond.

I mostly work with PHP, JavaScript and AWS; I'm also partial to experimenting with serverless, automated testing and real-time communications.

I've released a few projects and I tend to write about them [on my website](https://m1ke.me) or just in the README files.

If you like the projects I work on, many were started as part of my day job, as CTO of a proptech startup. We're hiring front and back end developers in the UK, so drop me a message if you'd like to work with us.
